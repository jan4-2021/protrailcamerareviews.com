Air compressors may seem like complicated devices and their use are limited to professional contractors and handymen. But the truth is, air compressors are really useful in our day-to-day lives and that professional contractors and homeowners alike will find it beneficial to have a good and efficient air compressor stashed in their homes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to review one of the most popular air compressors in the market today, the Makita MAC700 Big Bore 2.0 HP Air Compressor, and let&rsquo;s see if it fits the standards of a best air compressor overall.</p>
<p>The Makita MAC700 Big Bore 2.0 HP Air Compressor is a relatively quiet, low amp and oil-lubricated air compressor. It is manufactured by Makita, an industrial leader in creating power tools and accessories. Let&rsquo;s now check the key features of this air compressor, its advantages and disadvantages and see how it fares.</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Low Ampere</span></h2>
<p>Drawing on low amp, the Makita MAC700 Big Bore 2.0 HP Air Compressor is a great option as it does not trip breakers. Devices that draw high amps can cause drops in voltage. But in the case of the Big Bore, it only needs 12 amps to satisfy a full load. Compressors drawing high amps are more exposed to premature motor failure. On the other hand, working with a low amp compressor like the Big Bore helps ensure the motor will live a longer life and that you work without the annoying interruptions of tripped breakers.</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Noise</span></h2>
<p>The Makita MAC700 Big Bore 2.0 HP Air Compressor sits at around 80 decibel, making it relatively quiet. It definitely is not the quietest air compressor around and you can find compressors at 60 decibels, but the Big Bore is not the loudest at well. At 80 decibel, you can work with the Big Bore in relative silence and without disturbing your neighbors.</p>
<p>That being said, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about running the Big Bore in shared apartment and duplexes. Furthermore, the fact that it runs at 1750 RPM only makes it relatively quiet and emits lesser vibration.</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Power and Performance</span></h2>
<p>The Makita MAC700 Big Bore 2.0 HP Air Compressor has been aptly named as the Big Bore. Given the nickname, it can&rsquo;t be helped but to expect a lot from this product as far as power is concerned. Fortunately, Makita delivers to its claims as this air compressor is equipped with a motor running at 2 horsepower and a 2.6 gallon hotdog type tank, enabling the air compressor to approach 130 PSI at the maximum. The tank is adequate enough to perform all-around, small to medium compression jobs and it fills up quickly too. The tank capacity may seem limiting for demanding jobs, but the compressor can perform fairly well for inflation, automotive airbrushing and moderate home improvement projects with no issues.</p>
<p>It should be noted though that the Big Bore is not designed for continuous operations. Ideally, it should only be used for 30 minutes of continuous operations.</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pump</span></h2>
<p>The Big Bore comes with an oil-lubricated pump which further contributes to its silent operation. Compressors with oil-free pumps might require minimal maintenance, but oil-lubricated pumps are fare better for more serious and demanding jobs. Furthermore, having an oil-lubricated pump makes it more reliable. On the other hand, dealing with oil changes can get somewhat messy, but given that the air compressor comes with sight glass for you to see if there&rsquo;s still oil left and it drains easily, the little mess should just come as a minor annoyance.</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Portability</span></h2>
<p>The Big Bore weighs almost 60 pounds, making it heftier than other air compressors you&rsquo;d find in the market. Yes, it is a little on the heavy side, but that&rsquo;s generally because it&rsquo;s been constructed with cast iron. The handle has been strategically placed directly above the tank, making it easier to move around the workplace despite the weight. This design easily makes the air compressor manageable and portable, while emitting lower level of noise and vibration when in use.</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Pros of Makita MAC700 Big Bore 2.0 HP Air Compressor</span></h2>
<p>The Makita MAC700 Big Bore 2.0 HP Air Compressor has several pleasant features. First, the oil-lubricated pump means longer life span for the air compressing, allowing you to use it and maximize its value for many years to come. It is relatively quiet and its specially-designed handle makes it easy to move around. It is also powerful and efficient enough to satisfy the demands of compression jobs at home or at the professional setting.</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Cons of Makita MAC700 Big Bore 2.0 HP Air Compressor</span></h2>
<p>The Makita MAC700 Big Bore 2.0 HP Air Compressor is definitely not the lightest and quietest air compressor around. The Big Bore weights 60 lbs and works at 80 decibel, so if noise and weight are an issue for you, this could not be a great fit. Furthermore, some customers complain about the product manual being obscure and not very helpful.</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>The Big Bore stands as a good choice for being the best air compressor overall. It&rsquo;s easy to see that the pros far outweigh the cons and the latter are just minor inconveniences that are easy to overcome.</p>
<p>It operates in relative silence, it is fairly portable given its weight and it draws low amps. Add to that the fact that it comes with an oil-lubricated pump and high-quality cast iron design and you&rsquo;ll realize why this air compressor is versatile and powerful in different levels.</p>
<p>Given that the Big Bore is efficient, powerful and performs very well, it can be the compressor of choice for homeowners, handymen and even professional contractors working in the industrial settings. It does come with very impressive features, it has been intelligently designed and manufactured and it is also decently priced. Therefore, if you are looking for the overall best air compressor in the market, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001Q2VK0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0001Q2VK0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=proaircom-20&amp;linkId=VCTBW47AKQXIB73V">Makita MAC700 Big Bore 2.0 HP Air Compressor</a> would be your best bet.</p></body></html>
