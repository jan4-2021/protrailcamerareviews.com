These type of compressors are used for various purposes such as inflating tires, blow out pipelines, run flooring guns and provide pressurized air to HVAC systems.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market of porter cable air compressors and have limited budget, one of your best options could be the PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 3.5-Gallon 135 PSI Pancake Compressor. Its main points are oil-free pump, low amps draw and a 3.5 gallon tank delivering a maximum of 135 PSI. And when it comes to price, this Porter Cable air compressor is easily one of the most affordable, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BMUGQNC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BMUGQNC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=proaircom-20&amp;linkId=2URTPJUPACQ2NUJ3">available in Amazon at $99.88.</a><br>
Let&rsquo;s look at how the PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 3.5-Gallon 135 PSI Pancake Compressor fares when it comes to portability, power and performance, pump and tank style as well as noise and cost.</p>
<h2>Portability</h2>
<p>Weighing only 26 pounds, this air compressor is easily one of the lightest air compressors you&rsquo;ll find in the market today. That means you can easily bring it anywhere your project demands. You can even easily put at the back of your truck or your car&rsquo;s backseat with minimal effort. It has also a nicely-engineered handled that&rsquo;s attached to the housing of the electric motor, making it easier to balance while transporting it. If you&rsquo;re working on projects that needs the compressor to be relocated every so often, you&rsquo;ll see how easy and beneficial it is to own a lightweight and portable air compressor.</p>
<h2>Power and Performance</h2>
<p>For its price, I can say that the PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 is decently powerful. It may not be a good fit for demanding industrial compression jobs, but it does excellent jobs in the domestic and small-scale compression needs. The pump delivers 2.0 SCFM delivered @ 90 PSI which makes it quick to recover. Furthermore, the PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 can run efficiently even when you just use an extension cord instead of plugging it directly into the wall outlets. That being said, you can easily use the compressor outdoors as long as you are connected with power via an extension cord. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that you won&rsquo;t have problems of starting and running this compressor even in cold weather.<br>
The PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 can run with less power requirements. It only needs 120 V to run, making it convenient for all types of compressor users. With all these power and performance features, this simple, compact yet flexible the PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 can easily accomplish a wide range of jobs, including general inflation, roofing, framing and finishing jobs.</p>
<h2>Oil-Free Pump</h2>
<p>The PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 comes with an oil-free pump. Oil-free pumps have certain advantages over their oil-lubricated counterparts. First, since there&rsquo;s no oil to use and deal with, it lessens the maintenance required. Oil-free pumps also tend be lighter and can produce as much air flow and pressure as the pumps that are oil-lubricated. Therefore, if you&rsquo;re after lesser maintenance and deem that the air compressor will used for domestic and occasional DIY, then the PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 having oil-free pump makes it an advantage.</p>
<h2>Noise</h2>
<p>The PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 produces noise at 82 decibel. Some would consider this to relatively quiet, but a number of consumers do say that 82 decibels is noisy. To be safe though, you might want to use this air compressor when the neighbours have gone to work and your newborn is not sleeping.</p>
<h2>Pancake Style</h2>
<p>Since the PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 features a pancake-style tank, you can expect it to carry small-decent gallons of air capacity, making them the ideal choice for general compression jobs like tire inflation. Moreover, since the tank has no belt and carries an oil-free pump, the compressor in general is easier to maintain. However, if your projects are demanding and require larger air-powered tools, the PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 may not be the best choice.</p>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>For a price point of below $100, the PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 is easily one of<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BMUGQNC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BMUGQNC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=proaircom-20&amp;linkId=2URTPJUPACQ2NUJ3"> the best budget air compressors available</a>. This makes it a good option if you&rsquo;re owning an air compressor for the first time or contemplating of gifting someone else with a budget-friendly but useful air compressor.</p>
<h2>Advantages of the PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003</h2>
<p>Given the price and its many beneficial features, the PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 3.5-Gallon 135 PSI Pancake Compressor does make a good option for a homeowner, DIY enthusiast and for those with limited budget. The PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 can easily perform most compression jobs without a problem. It comes with an oil-free pump for lesser maintenance, wear and tear, plus it is portable and light enough to be carried anywhere. It is also efficient, durable and powerful to meet most compression needs.</p>
<h2>Disadvantages of the PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 isn&rsquo;t the quietest air compressor there is. Although some people would say that air compressors are in general loud and noisy, there are air compressors with low decibel that don&rsquo;t disturb the neighbours when used. If noise is an issue for you and the surroundings, then this comes as a minor annoyance.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Apart from the noise, the PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 3.5-Gallon 135 PSI Pancake Compressor does seem like a good choice as far as cost and power is concerned. It is versatile enough to perform most compression jobs without any issues and it is light enough to be taken anywhere.&nbsp;The PORTER-CABLE PCFP02003 3.5-Gallon 135 PSI Pancake Compressor should come recommendable for air compressor users who are looking for the best budget air compressor.
