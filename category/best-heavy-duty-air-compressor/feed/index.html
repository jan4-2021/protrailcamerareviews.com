While there&rsquo;s a lot of products that can fall under the category of the best heavy duty air compressor, Rolair 5. 5 HP Honda, 9.3 CF is just worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;is a wheelbarrow-type air compressor that boasts of rugged build and design; high CFM output and immense portability. Let us inspect the different features of this air compressor and decide whether this is truly worth the purchase.</p>
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>The Rolair 5. 5 HP Honda, 9.3 CF is an industrial-grade air compressor featuring a Honda engine able to provide 5.5 horsepower. The engine comes with an automatic idle-down which aids in making fuel consumption more efficient while the atmospheric unloading system prevents unnecessary oil consumption. The Rolair 5. 5 HP Honda, 9.3 CF is a good choice for home improvement contractors and in industries demanding higher output of air pressure where traditional air compressors falls short.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The Rolair 5. 5 HP Honda, 9.3 CF comes with a single stage twin cylinders in cast iron. The compressor has a wheelbarrow configuration which makes the entire compressor mightily portable despite the size and weight. Locating the tanks at the bottom also make the compressor easier to move around rough terrains without having to sustain damages. This makes the Rolair 5. 5 HP Honda, 9.3 CF a great choice for jobsites and in industrial settings.</p>
<p>The air compressor&rsquo;s assembled weight is 150 pounds, which many would consider as heavy. But given that the compressor is designed for heavy duty use and comes with twin cast-iron tanks, this is already expected. To make up for the weight issue, its wheelbarrow design does make the air compressor easy to transport from one site to another.</p>
<h2>Gas-Powered</h2>
<p>The compressor comes with a gas-powered engine fully equipped with die-cast aluminum alloy, retractable starter and cast-iron sleeve among others. Unlike electric-powered air compressors, gas-powered ones such as the Rolair 5. 5 HP Honda, 9.3 CF are convenient to be used in open spaces and sites where access to electric power is difficult or limited. Since gas-powered air compressors come with pilot unloader valve, you will be able to use the air compressor for a longer period of time and continuously, making them more ideal to satisfy heavy duty jobs.</p>
<p>However, gas-powered air compressors are not good choice for closed settings, so you better keep the Rolair 5. 5 HP Honda, 9.3 CF away from home use. Gas air compressors can emit fumes that are dangerous to human health. While this is not an issue in open spaces, it can be a hazard to such compressor indoors.</p>
<h2>Power and Performance</h2>
<p>Rolair 5. 5 HP Honda, 9.3 CF features 9.3 CFM at 90 PSI. This makes the air compressor a true work horse where power and performance are concerned. At this rate, the compressor has the capability of 3-5 framing guns or 4-7 roofing guns. Meanwhile, the compressor&rsquo;s design for fuel economy and long life are from the fact that the engine is equipped with atmospheric unloading system and automatic engine idle. Furthermore, this air compressor has 15,000 hours of life expectancy and 70% duty cycle.</p>
<h2>Other Key Features</h2>
<p>This air compressor is easily tightened with the use of Schmidt belt-tightening device. It also comes with two-piece 16 gauge bolted belt guard which are industrial-grade and fully pneumatic tire with sealant. The compressor also comes with all the necessary accessories like ball valve drains, throttle control assembly and cold-start valve among others.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Rolair 5. 5 HP Honda, 9.3</h2>
<p>Rolair 5. 5 HP Honda, 9.3 is truly a good choice as a heavy duty air compressor. It is fully equipped with a powerful gas-powered engine, capable of delivering 9.3 CFM at 90 PSI which is already pretty impressive. Add to that the fact that the engine has 5.5 horsepower and you have an industrial-grade air compressor at your hands.</p>
<p>This air compressor also comes with durable steel, twin tanks that can store up to 9 gallons of air. It is also equipped with safety features to prevent unnecessary fuel loss as well keep fuel consumption more efficient.</p>
<p>Rolair 5. 5 HP Honda, 9.3 has a wheelbarrow configuration that makes it portable and easy to relocate where a heavy duty air compressor is required.</p>
<h2>Disadvantages of Rolair 5. 5 HP Honda, 9.3</h2>
<p>Rolair 5. 5 HP Honda, 9.3 does come with a few drawbacks. First, it is mighty heavy at 150 pounds. Some air compressors weight less than 30 pounds and they are truly portable. However, Rolair 5. 5 HP Honda, 9.3 is also portable despite its weight because it&rsquo;s been configured as a wheelbarrow type, making it easier to transport.</p>
<p>Additionally, while gas-powered air compressors are beneficial in remote jobsites, they are less flexible and helpful indoors. You must not use gas-powered air compressors in closed spaces as these compressors emit fumes that can be dangerous to your health.</p>

It is durable to meet the demands of heavy duty air compression jobs, and it is fully equipped with all the necessary gears to make this air compressor last a very long time.
