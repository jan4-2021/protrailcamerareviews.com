When the air compressor gets too noisy, it&rsquo;s easy to feel embarrassed for disturbing or waking your next-door neighbors.</p>
<p>Fortunately, air compressor manufacturers have figured out ways to lower the decibels, allowing you to have meaningful conversation even when the air compressor is running. The times have definitely changed as they<br>
bring us one of the most quiet air compressors out there.</p>
<h2><strong>Noise Level </strong></h2>
<p>Since California Air Tools CAT &ndash; 6310 claims to be one of the most quiet air compressors, the first thing we will definitely need to look at is its noise level.

You can use the compressor overnight or for a longer period of time without fearing of disturbing your neighbors and you can even take it out and not disturb anybody.</p>
<h2><strong>Portability</strong></h2>
<p>Due to the fact that the California Air Tools CAT &ndash; 6310 weighs just around 49 pounds, this air compressor is so portable that you can easily relocate it where your project demands to. However, it could also be light enough to sustain defects and damages when knocked over.</p>
<h2><strong>Durability </strong></h2>
<p>California Air Tools CAT &ndash; 6310 is a durable air compressor in the sense that it operates with only 1680 RPM. In air compressors, lower RPM is indicative of lower vibration and noise and the motor is less prone to wear. However, design-wise it can be noted that California Air Tools CAT &ndash; 6310 is too exposed, and given that it is portable; it can be prone to hazards. While the tank is made of steel, it should be noted that there are no protective casings for the gauges and motor, leaving them exposed and out in the open.</p>
<h2><strong>Performance </strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00889ZYPQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00889ZYPQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=proaircom-20&amp;linkId=WKOMPOV6LBDNHSFD">The California Air Tools CAT &ndash; 6310 is oil-free with the capability of providing 2.35 CFM at 90 PS</a>.

<h2><strong>Dual Piston Pump</strong></h2>
<p>Also one of the California Air Tools CAT &ndash; 6310&rsquo;s most notable features is its dual piston pump. Compared to air compressors with single pump, it&rsquo;s easy to see which this air compressor with dual piston pump is more efficient.

Furthermore, having two pumps means the air compressor have longer life and boasts a life-cycle of 3000 hours.</p>
<h2><strong>Maintenance</strong></h2>
<p>California Air Tools CAT &ndash; 6310 requires relatively lesser maintenance than other conventional air-compressors. It comes with an oil-free pump that makes maintenance less of a burden. It comes with a valve ball that makes draining water out a breeze. Since the tank is made of steel, there&rsquo;s always a good chance of rust developing over time. To prevent this, drain the tank of moisture every 2 to 3 days. Meanwhile, the air filter has an impressive 5000 hours of life cycle.</p>
<h2><strong>The Pros of California Air Tools CAT &ndash; 6310</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to being the most quiet air compressor, California Air Tools CAT &ndash; 6310 certainly makes a good contender. You might be able to find quieter air compressors, but at 60 decibel, this air compressor does work in impressive silence.</p>
<p>It is also pretty portable, powerful and efficient for most jobs. The dual piston pumps also make the air compressor more longer-lasting.</p>
